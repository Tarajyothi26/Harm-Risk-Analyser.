# Harm-Focused Misinformation Risk Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Harm-Focused Misinformation Risk Analysis is an academic AI-based project designed to analyze digital content and identify misinformation that may cause real-world harm. Instead of only checking factual accuracy, the system focuses on *risk, intent, and potential impact*.

This project is built for learning, research, and demonstration purposes.
